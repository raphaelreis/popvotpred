# Votation outcomes prediction


My goal is here to predict the Swiss votation outcomes based on all publicly available data. The main assumption here is to say that everybody is influenced by is enivronment. It means that we assume we are influenced by geographical situation, social status, what we read, etc... 


## Plan:
### Acquisition
    0. Get litterature on the subject
    1. Get all the data that is available online (mainly admistration official documents like: le feuillet explicatif, les livrets de partis, etc..)
    2. Clean the data

### Exploration
    1. Find the political tendency of any official text. Relate it to who did it.
    2. Find a way to aggregate huge amount of information.
    
### Exploitation
    1. Find how related are the official bulletin to the actual outcomes
    2. Predict the outcome of cantonal/federal votation for past votations
    3. Predict outcomes for future votation
### Results
